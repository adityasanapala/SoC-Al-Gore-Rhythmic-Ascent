# Week 1 (21 May - 27 May): Basic Problems and Data Structures

## Goals for the week

- First, get a hang of coding by implementing a `Vec3` Class in the programming language of your convenience.
- Learn about time complexity, timing your code, and basic data structures (arrays, vectors, stacks and queues).
- Solve some basic problems on these topics.
- (**Optional**) Do the competitive programming section.

## üõ†Ô∏è Task Breakdown

### 1. The Vector Class

Create a C++ class with the following:

- Constructor: `Vec3(float x, float y, float z)`
- Operator overloads: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, unary `-`, `[]`
- Methods:
  - `unit()`
  - `length()`
  - `dot(const Vec3& other)`
  - `cross(const Vec3& other)`
  - `reflect(const Vec3& normal)`
  - `refract(const Vec3& normal, float refractive_index)`

üß™ **Testing**

- Use the provided `./test` executable to validate your `Vec3` class.

### 2. Theory Concepts

- Asymptotic Notation:
  - [Harvard CS50 - Asymptotic Notation (video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOq5kSKqeR4)
  - [Skiena (video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1mkCe3kVUA)
- Arrays and Vectors:
  - [Harvard CS50 - Arrays (video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tI_tIZFyKBw&t=3009s)
  - [Dynamic Arrays (video)](https://www.coursera.org/lecture/data-structures/dynamic-arrays-EwbnV)
- Stack and Queue:
  - [Stack and Queue (slides)](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~akg/courses/2024-ds/lec-03-stack-queue.pdf)

---

### 3. Problems

- ### Questions to be submitted:
  1. Implement vector using array (w1\_q1.cpp/py)
  2. Implement stack using array (w1\_q2.cpp/py)
  3. Implement queue using array (w1\_q3.cpp/py)

### 4. Tasks for Competitive Programming

- Complete reading the first 4 chapters from [Competitive Programmer's Handbook](https://cses.fi/book/book.pdf).
- Create your accounts on [CSES](https://cses.fi/), [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/), [Codechef](https://www.codechef.com/) and [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/).
- If you wish to study any of the data structures in detail, then please use this [link](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~akg/courses/2024-ds/). But I believe you will be able to pick up all the data structures knowledge as you will move forward. So, no need to memorize stuff, you will be able to learn through practice.
- Go through your CS101 slides or the link for basic algorithms such as [binary search](https://cp-algorithms.com/num_methods/binary_search.html), and sorting algorithms.
- Then read this [document ]()thoroughly. If you have any questions on this document, please feel free to ask in the group. 
- You need to submit only the first set of the following questions in your corresponding folder. Also, your code should pass all the testcases present on either CSES or Codeforces.

- ### Questions to be submitted:
    1. [Missing Number](https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1083) (w1\_q1.cpp)
    1. [Repetitions](https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1069) (w1\_q2.cpp)
    1. [Coins](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1814/A) (w1\_q3.cpp)
    1. [Lucky Numbers](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1808/A) (w1\_q4.cpp)
    1. [Weird Algorithm](https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1068) (w1\_q5.cpp)

- ### Questions for your practice:
    1. [Increasing Array](https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1094)
    1. [Towers of Hanoi](https://cses.fi/problemset/task/2165)
    1. [Coin Piles](https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1754)
    1. [Walking Master](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1806/A)
    1. [Two Knights](https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1072)
 
      
- All those who are new to CP, this week is going to be a bit heavy. Feel free to ask us for more time. But make sure that you complete all the questions honestly, else this project won‚Äôt be able to help you much.
